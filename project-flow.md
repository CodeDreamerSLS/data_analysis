1. data analysis flow:
    --data importing to sql server
    --coding in sql server and save the results to sql server
    --connect sql server to powerbi
    --create charts and analysis results in powerbi


we used window function to filter the data but while pushing in amazond rds it 
keeps executing so we use it in localhost and filter duplicates data
and save it in csv file and import this data in ApplicationRecord table
